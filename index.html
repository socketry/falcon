	<h1 style="text-align: center"><img src="logo.svg"/></h1><p>Falcon is a multi-process, multi-fiber rack-compatible HTTP server built on top of <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">async</a>, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-io">async-io</a>, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-container">async-container</a> and <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-http">async-http</a>. Each request is executed within a lightweight fiber and can block on up-stream requests without stalling the entire server process. Falcon supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 natively.</p>

<section id="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Initially, when I developed <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">async</a>, I saw an opportunity to implement <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-http">async-http</a>: providing both client and server components. After experimenting with these ideas, I decided to build an actual web server for comparing and validating performance primarily out of interest. Falcon grew out of those experiments and permitted the ability to test existing real-world code on top of <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">async</a>.</p>
<p>Once I had something working, I saw an opportunity to simplify my development, testing and production environments, replacing production (Nginx+Passenger) and development (Puma) with Falcon. Not only does this simplify deployment, it helps minimize environment-specific bugs.</p>
<p>My long term vision for Falcon is to make a web application platform which trivializes server deployment. Ideally, a web application can fully describe all it's components: HTTP servers, databases, periodic jobs, background jobs, remote management, etc. Currently, it is not uncommon for all these facets to be handled independently in platform specific ways. This can make it difficult to set up new instances as well as make changes to underlying infrastructure. I hope Falcon can address some of these issues in a platform agnostic way.</p>
<p>As web development is something I'm passionate about, having a server like Falcon is empowering.</p>
